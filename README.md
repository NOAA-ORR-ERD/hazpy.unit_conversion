hazpy.unit_conversion
=====================

Unit conversion code developed by NOAA Emergency Response division.

http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/

This code was developed for use with  in-house applications used for oil and chemical response needs. As such is has a number
of the unusual units we need (e.g. API gravity), but none of the unusual units we don't (e.g. fathoms per fortnight)

It is used as the core conversion in the Desktop app:  NOAA Unit Converter for Oil Spills (NUCOS):

As it was developed by the US federal government, this code is in the Public Domain. Nevertheless, it would be nice to give us credit if you use it for something.
